# KNTY TOON ADD-ON

## Introduction

### What is Toon Shader

Toon shaders are a type of NPR (non-photorealistic rendering) shader that is used to create a stylized, cartoon-like appearance in Blender. Toon shaders are often used to give 3D models and scenes a simplified, cel-shaded look, similar to traditional 2D animations or comic books. Toon shaders can be useful for creating stylized animations, concept art, and other types of visual media where a realistic appearance is not necessary or desired. To use toon shaders in Blender, you will need to have a basic understanding of the node-based material system and be familiar with how to create and manipulate materials and textures. There are a variety of toon shaders available in Blender, each with its own unique set of features and parameters that allow you to customize the look and feel of the shader. Toon shaders can be combined with other shaders and techniques to achieve a wide range of artistic looks and styles.

### What is Halftone Shader

A halftone toon shader is a type of NPR (non-photorealistic rendering) shader that is used to create a stylized, cartoon-like appearance in Blender. The halftone toon shader creates the effect by applying a halftone pattern to the material, which is a series of dots that are used to create the illusion of shading and gradations of tone in printed images. This can give the material a unique, hand-drawn look that is often associated with traditional print media such as newspapers and comic books. To use the halftone toon shader in Blender, you will need to have a basic understanding of the node-based material system and be familiar with how to create and manipulate materials and textures.
